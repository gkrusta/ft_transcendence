## Tech Stack

- **Backend:**
	- Django (Python)
	- PostgreSQL (Database)
	- REST APIs
	- Redis (for caching and real-time data)
	- Blockchain (for tournament data)
- **Frontend:**
	- Bootstrap (CSS framework)
	- JavaScript (ES6+)
	- HTML5 / CSS3
- **Authentication:**
	 API for OAuth-based remote authentication
- **Microservices:**
	- Docker for containerization
	- Redis for real-time functionality

## Setup

### Prerequisites

	- Unix-based operating system

	Ensure the following are installed on your machine:
	- Docker
	- Docker Compose

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/gkrusta/ft_transcendence.git
	cd ft_transcendence
	```

2. Set up environment variables:
	reate a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file and configure it with your environment details, including your 42 API credentials, PostgreSQL, Redis, and blockchain configurations.

3. Build and run the application using Docker Compose through Makeflie:
	```bash
	make
	```

	This will start all necessary services, including the backend (Django), PostgreSQL, Redis, and any additional microservices.

### Blockchain Setup

	To enable blockchain integration for tournament data storage, ensure that your blockchain node or service is properly configured. Update the relevant environment variables in the `.env` file for the blockchain connection.

## Usage

1. **User Registration & Login:**
	Users can register and log in using the in-app authentication system, or via the 42 API for OAuth-based authentication.

2. **Game Play:**
	- Players can challenge each other to real-time multiplayer matches.
	- If no human players are available, users can play against an AI opponent.

3. **Live Chat:**
	ayers can use the integrated real-time chat to communicate during games.

4. **Tournaments:**
	- Players can join and participate in tournaments, with all results stored securely on the blockchain.
	- The tournament history is verifiable through the blockchain.

5. **Multilingual Support:**
	Users can change the interface language from the settings menu.

## Docker Management

- **Stopping the services:**
	```bash
	make clean
	```
- **Rebuilding the containers after code changes:**
	```bash
	make re
	```
- **Watch container logs:**
	```bash
	make logs
	```
